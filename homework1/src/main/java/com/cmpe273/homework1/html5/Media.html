    <h1>What is the best thing you have ever heard a teacher say?</h1>
    <p>My high school physics teacher started his course as follows:</p>

    <p>“If any of you came here expecting me to teach you anything, you might as well leave. Those of you who came here to learn should stay.”</p>

    <p>This was the first time I clearly understood my education as being self-directed, rather than response to parental and teacher demands.</p>

    <p>I have never forgotten him or those words. I may even remember some of the physics, too.</p>
    
    <p>If you print this page, or open it in print preview, you will see that it is styled with the media="print" stylesheet. The "print" stylesheet contains black text on white background.</p>
